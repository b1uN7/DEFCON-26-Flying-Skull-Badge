DEFCON 26 Flying Skull Badge

*** QUICK UPDATE: GETTING STARTED WITH YOU BADGE ***                   

*** (AKA GETTING YOUR BADGE STARTED) VIDEO IS NOW POSTED TO WIKI ***


Ok, so if you are here, you are probably looking for flying badge stuff like "how the f*$K do I put this thing together" or "it won't stop bliking, why won't it stop blinking"

This site (in time) will answer all those questions.

For now, until I can get stuff up on Thursday (I won't commit to which Thursday I am talking about) here are the answers to those questions:

Q1: How to put it together?

A1: If you are a hacker, figure it out!  If you are not a hacker, why the f*%K do you have a hacker badge? 


Q2: How do I get this stupid-ass badge to stop blinking?

A2: See Q1

Ok, only kidding.  If you don't have a sense of humor and you expect everything to be perfect, then "this is not the badge you are looking for" <virtual hand swipe>

If you are here, then you probably know me enough to realize if it took me a year longer to get you your badge, then you will have figured out I am behind on the documentation (*WHAT, you say, I DIDN'T DO THE DOCUMENTATION FIRST OR ALONG THE WAY???  WTF???)

So be patient and lets work together.  I will be using this repository's wiki to post a lot of the stuff you are looking for (build instructions, videos, my home address so you can come kick me in the balls for making this stupid badge, etc).  As we are a hacker community, it would be great if we worked together and post all our combined shit there!  PLEASE be and ACTIVE part of this process!!  I encourage you to post, advise, answer, and collectively curse at me for doing this to you!!
